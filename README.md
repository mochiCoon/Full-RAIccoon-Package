# Full RAIccoon Package

A brand-neutral, local-first deployment skeleton for analyst teams that want a working starting point for:

- an internal operations/research portal
- reusable Hermes-style analyst skills
- a local VirtualBox malware-analysis sandbox
- optional OpenCTI report ingestion scaffolding
- deployment scripts that are easy to customize for each organization

This repository intentionally ships without organization branding, private data, report artifacts, credentials, or live environment state. Treat it as a skeleton: clone it, add your own branding, tune workflows, and wire it into your own infrastructure.

## What is included

```

## Quick start: local portal

Prerequisites:
- Linux, macOS, or WSL2 for the portal
- Python 3.10+
- `uv` recommended, or `python3 -m venv`
- optional: Hermes CLI if you want AI-backed workflow dispatch

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lost0x01/Full-RAIccoon-Package.git
cd Full-RAIccoon-Package
cp .env.example .env
scripts/bootstrap.sh
scripts/run-portal.sh
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8008
```

Default bootstrap credentials are only for first boot:

```text
username: admin
password: change-me-now
```

Change them in `.env` before any shared deployment.

## Quick start: local sandbox

The sandbox is local-first and assumes you maintain isolated VirtualBox guests.

Required host tools vary by workflow, but commonly include:
- VirtualBox / VBoxManage
- tshark / capinfos
- dnsmasq
- 7z
- xorriso
- OpenSSL
- optional REMnux analysis VM
- optional Suricata, YARA, Volatility, python-evtx

```bash
cd components/local-sandbox
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[test]'
python3 -m raiccoon_sandbox.local_vbox_detonate --help
```

Never bridge malware VMs to production networks. Use host-only networking and handle all artifacts as potentially malicious.

### WSL2 note

The portal and skills work normally in WSL2. The malware sandbox can use Windows-host Oracle VirtualBox through the WSL adapter in:

```text
components/local-sandbox/adapters/wsl/
```

Start with:

```bash
cd components/local-sandbox
adapters/wsl/setup-wsl-vboxmanage.sh
```

Then read:

```text
components/local-sandbox/docs/wsl-windows-virtualbox.md
```

WSL mode is best treated as an advanced bridge. Validate host-only networking, DNS simulation, packet capture, and Guest Additions before using it for real samples. A dedicated Linux lab host remains the recommended high-assurance malware-analysis deployment.

## Optional OpenCTI

`deploy/opencti/docker-compose.yml` is a starter compose file for teams that want local OpenCTI. It is intentionally generic and requires you to provide secrets in a local `.env` file.

The portal and report workflows can be tuned to publish final reports into OpenCTI as Report objects. Purple-team/RFI style workflows should keep their visible report family separate from their OpenCTI classification.

## Branding and tuning

Add your organization-specific material in these places:

- `components/portal/static/` for logo/CSS assets
- `components/portal/templates/` for navigation labels and page copy
- `.env` for portal title/admin/runtime settings
- `skills/` for internal analyst playbooks
- `components/local-sandbox/configs/local.example.yaml` for VM names, snapshots, and network values

Avoid committing:
- API tokens
- real client names
- report PDFs/DOCX
- malware samples
- detonation outputs
- portal SQLite databases
- private OpenCTI credentials

## Deployment model

Recommended rollout for a small team:

1. Clone this repo on an internal host.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set a real secret/admin password.
3. Bind the portal to localhost first.
4. Put it behind VPN/Tailscale/reverse proxy before exposing it to a team.
5. Configure CIDR allowlisting in both the app and reverse proxy.
6. Install the systemd unit after local smoke tests pass.
7. Only then add branding, OpenCTI, and sandbox VM details.

## Commands

```bash
# bootstrap portal venv and local dirs
scripts/bootstrap.sh

# run portal in foreground
scripts/run-portal.sh

# run basic repository checks
scripts/smoke-test.sh

# scan for common private branding/secrets before publishing
scripts/sanitize-check.sh
```

## Security notes

- CIDR allowlisting in the app is defense-in-depth, not your only boundary.
- Use network controls: VPN, Tailscale, firewall rules, SSO/reverse proxy, or VLAN ACLs.
- Rotate bootstrap credentials before real use.
- Do not expose the malware sandbox to untrusted users.
- Do not store samples or analysis outputs in Git.

## Status

This is a working skeleton extracted from an internal deployment pattern and sanitized for reuse. It is intended to get partner organizations to a useful starting point quickly while leaving room for their own branding, workflow tuning, and security controls.
